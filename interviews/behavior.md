# Behavior

**Tell me about yourself**

      I have been in the industry for over 3 years, primarily working in web backend and full stack development. Well, I am currently a software engineer at Visa, where I design and develop features for enterprise reconciliation system which reconciles millions of transactions for Visa per day within a team of developers, qa engineers, and treasury clients. Now I am looking to expand my experience across different industries, particularly in insuretech, which is why i am so interested in joining Ethos life.



**Receive critical feedback**

 _In the past, Iâ€™ve been told to_ 

#### Tell me about a time you overcame an obstacle

In the recent work I did at Visa, I was assigned to design/develop file upload, parsing, and management of new user transaction report. The requirements was ambiguous under constrained deadline. I actively researched, set up meetings to ask questions and go over design. At end, I completed a mvp within given time and received recognitions from all team members involved.

**Why leave?**

For Amazon: I'm looking for an opportunity where I can fully leverage my skills and experience, while also balancing time with family and friends. I believe we perform our best when we have a healthy balance between work and life."

For Visa: I am seeking out opportunities that will allow me to make full use of my newly acquired backend and cloud skills.
