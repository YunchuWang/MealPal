# Scalability

Scalability = ability to ****maintain good performance under larger workload

There is no system scalable by definition as load can increase, but we need to think how to deal with higher load

**What is load? load can be defined with several parameters depending on your system. Maybe tps, or dau, or hit rate on cache...**
